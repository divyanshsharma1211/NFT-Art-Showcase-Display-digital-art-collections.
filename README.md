## Description

NFT Art Showcase is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables artists and collectors to create and manage digital art collections. This decentralized platform allows users to showcase their NFT artworks in organized collections, providing a structured way to display digital art pieces with comprehensive metadata including titles, artist information, images, and descriptions.

The smart contract provides core functionality for:
- Creating personalized art collections
- Adding detailed artwork entries to collections
